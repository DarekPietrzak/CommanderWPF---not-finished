# CommanderWPF---not-finished
NOT Finished YET!!!! Very simple (maybe a little poor) file manger ....

I'm coding CommanderWPF. I started in middle of January 2017. It is WPF Application, I'm writing in C#. 
At now this app looks very poor, becouse i still  working on this project not permanently.
At now working not brillant browsing of file/directory structure.
Some functions were writing, but still didn't pin-up.

At now I'm correcting features of Browsing, coppying, moving....
